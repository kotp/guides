High level guidelines:

* Be consistent.
* Don't rewrite existing code to follow this guide.
* Don't violate a guideline without a good reason.
* A reason is good when you can convince a teammate.

A note on the language:

* "Avoid" means don't do it unless you have good reason.
* "Don't" means there's never a good reason.
* "Prefer" indicates a better option and its alternative to watch out for.
* "Use" is a positive instruction.
